# NoteTaker

Write, save, and delete notes!


This application uses an Express.js back-end to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

I wrote the back-end, connected the front-end, and then deployed the application to Heroku.

Application front end connects to an Express.js back end.

Application back end stores notes with unique IDs in a JSON file.

Application is deployed to Heroku.
